Using with forks/other chains
=============================

While not officially supported nor tested, you can use this library to trade across several Uniswap forks, like:

- Sushiswap (mainnet)
- Honeyswap (xDai)
- Pancakeswap (BSC)
- And any other forks that don't deviate too much from the ABI.

See the issues for details about how to do so.
